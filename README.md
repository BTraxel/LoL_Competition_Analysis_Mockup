# League of Legends Analyzer

Welcome to the League of Legends Analyzer repository! This repository serves as a basic mockup for a future Java application designed to analyze the results of League of Legends competitions. Please note that the technology stack and architecture are subject to change as the project evolves.

## Features

- **Multi-Mode Analysis**: The application is designed to offer analysis for multiple game modes, including ARAM, Twisted Treeline, and Classic games.

- **Data Extraction**: While the data extraction functionality is not fully implemented yet, a mock CSV data file is provided to test the application's functionality and generate analysis reports.
